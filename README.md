# Image-Segmention-Notebook
Self-contained jupyter notebook comparing support vector machines (SVMs) with neural-networks for Gaussian Mixture classifcation and image-segmentation tasks. Image segmentation based off TensorFlow tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation (with simpler structure/no pre-trained models for U-Net).
